										<p>Shannon R. Poppito, Ph.D. is a Licensed Clinical Psychologist with over 20 years of clinical training, experience and expertise in helping navigate clients through some of the most challenging periods and transitions of their lives.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Dr. Poppito has helped shepherd patients through chronic medical illness (as a Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center fellowship trained Psycho-Oncologist specializing in cancer and End of Life care), and helped minister to military returning from war (as a DoD trained Integrative Behavioral Health Consultant). 
											</li>
											<li>
												She has co-authored books on helping cancer patients find meaning & purpose in Life (e.g., 'Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy in Advanced Cancer'), and has published and presented extensively on existential-developmental issues through the Life-Span, as well as various Life-Transitional Stress Management themes in general therapeutic and medical (cancer, long term + palliative) care.
											</li>
											<li>
												Dr. Poppito's clinical training + experience spans from an Existential-Spiritual Therapy framework (Ph.D. - Duquesne University) toward a more pragmatic solution-focused Integrative Behavioral Health (Healthy Lifestyle Management) approach to taking care of the body + mind along with one's overall Life/existence.
											</li>
											<li>
												She, therefore, specializes in providing an integrative (physical-mental-spiritual-existential) approach toward navigating clients out of seemingly dark and challenging periods in their lives, by inspiring and empowering them to find their own inner-resources of fortitude and resiliency (via: self-care, meaning + purpose) to face and overcome any 'seasonal' Life-transition.]

									<h2 class="major">About VITA Therapy</h2>
									<h3 class="major">VITA Therapy: Overview</h3>
									<p>The main vision for VITA Therapy is to encourage clients to fully LIVE in the face of necessary, yet challenging, Life-transitions.  ‘VITA’ means Life, in all its many forms, seasons, phases and cycles.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											Just as all seasons have a beginning, middle and end--comfortable and not-so-comfortable periods--so, too, does VITA Therapy take on a similar therapeutic Life-path. Just as all Life-transitions--seasons and therapy should not last forever--'This, too, shall pass.'
										</li>
										<li>
											VITA therapy was designed to tackle a specifically identified 'seasonal life-transition' (See: Seasons below)--helping to navigate the person, in a goal-oriented, solution focused manner, through the beginning, middle and end of this particular life transition; with the ultimate goal of launching from VITA Therapy when Life-goals and transitions have been mastered.
										</li>
										<li>
											While navigating through such necessary existential-developmental transitions can be tricky, and feel daunting, at times--a well-trained, and highly qualified, transitional presence (navigator + guide) may be all that’s needed to traverse Life's transitional journey to the other side.] 
										</li>
									</ul>

									<h3 class="major">V.I.T.A.: Vital Involvement in Therapeutic Action</h3>
									<p>The ethic of VITA Therapy derives from de-stigmatizing therapy; focusing less on pathologizing a person into needing therapy to overcome depression or anxiety--and centering more on the human life-transitional context of adjusting to and coming to terms with natural and necessary transitions (or crisis ‘turning points’) in life. This requires action. VITA Therapy challenges a person to become vitally involved in life through therapeutic action. That is, actively facing and engaging with the challenging Life-change at hand in a pragmatic, solution-focused and purpose-driven manner. </p>
									
									<h3 class="major">VITA Therapy: Navigating Through the Seasons of Life</h3>
									<p>The work of VITA Therapy is to help navigate clients through the often challenging, yet eye-opening, seasons of Life-transitions--in order to reawaken them to their given meaning, purpose + potential in Life. Navigating through the seemingly paradoxical nature of Life's seasonal endings and new beginnings....accomplishments, disappointments + disillusionments...can feel quite overwhelming at times.  VITA therapy helps celebrate the many births of new life, love + experiences...while learning to grieve the various 'mini-deaths'--of broken hopes + dreams, transitions in identity, autonomy, responsibility--that naturally pervade Life. The goal of VITA Therapy is to re-engage and empower the individual to move in and through these ever-unfolding 'Seasons of Life', while moving ever-closer toward their most vital and authentic selves in the process.</p>

											<h3 class="major">The Spring of Life:</h3>
											<p>This is the season of facing new beginnings... Preparatory launching... Forging ahead into a new life and identity... New healthy age/stage-appropriate (psycho-developmental) milestones.  Facing the happy, yet often daunting, challenges of a new relationship, starting new job, launching new business, move to college or new city/state, adjusting to parenthood, etc.</p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													Commencing college; choosing career
												</li>
												<li>
													Embarking on new relationship
												</li>
												<li>
													Starting new job or career

											<h3 class="major">The Summer of Life:</h3>
											<p>This is the season of acclimating to the new... The summer of life should be bright and shining--full of potential, happiness and growth... Yet, something in the acclimating period can be quite challenging and daunting to one's sense of identity; really challenging a person's grounding/rootedness and place in the world...Life-transitions that 'should be happy' - but are difficult to face (*See examples below):</p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													New Baby - "All the moms look so happy + care-free--why do I feel so guilty for feeling the opposite?"
												</li>
												<li>
													'Empty Nest' - "My children have finally launched - I should be relieved - why am I so sad + anxious?"
												</li>
												<li>
													Retirement - "Everyone says these are my golden years - why do I feel so lost + directionless?"
												</li>
											</ul>

											<h3 class="major">The Fall of Life:</h3>
											<p>This is the season of necessary separations, disconnections + dis-attachments...But, still a vital and alive transitional time for growth + renewal. Just as brightly colored leaves separate from the Tree of Life, so, too, does the Fall represent relational and occupational separations from an original Life source.</p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													Relational separations encompass disconnecting from those we loved (e.g., divorce, break-up, family or friendship rifts, old-age - loneliness + losing vital connections, falling away from God/church).
												</li>
												<li>
													Occupational separations include leaving a purpose-driven activity:  job (voluntary or otherwise), retirement, losing passion/purpose in life goals, needing a career shift/change.
												</li>
											</ul>

											<h3 class="major">The Winter of Life:</h3>
											<p>This is the season of endings, losses, disappointments, disillusionments...or even death, itself. A season of coming to terms with LIVING in the face of dying...Dying to an old self that needs to be reborn....Transitioning from post-traumatic stress (via illness, divorce, death) toward post-traumatic growth:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													Being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness (cancer or debilitating disease)
												</li>
												<li>
													Recovering from a life-threatening traumatic event (house-fire, natural disaster or accident)
												</li>
												<li>
													Struggling with care-giver burnout ("compassion-fatigue") - taking care of loved ones
												</li>
												<li>
													Finding LIFE after the death of a dream (e.g., infertility, miscarriage, failing at a life-goal/task, etc).
												</li>
												<li>
													Coming to terms with living beyond the death of a loved one via Grief & Bereavement support.
